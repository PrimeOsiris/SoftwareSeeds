    <h1>About the Creator</h1>
    <p class="solid">
        My name is Lochlan Dunne and I first came up with the idea for this project as part of a University Project which I had not realised I would have to implement/create at the time.
        For this reason, I was not prepared, mentally at least, for the task of implementing my proposal and may have set me expectations a little high.
        I enjoy the outcomes and the process of creating things, with writing being my main creative outlet. For this reason, I find programming fairly enjoyable as it is, to me at least,
        a different way of using writing to create something. I intend for this website to be a resource for people who are learning to use that writing, containing examples that can be followed.
